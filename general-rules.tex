\chapter{The Broad of It}
\chaplabel{general-rules}

This chapter covers rules essential to day-to-day play.
Players and GMs alike should be familiar with at least the major points in here in order to play.
More specific rules, pertaining to various disciplines of magic, can be found in the appropriate chapters of \partref{disciplines}.

It is important to remember that this book cannot cover every situation that may arise during play.
The role of the GM includes adjudicating such scenarios, and the following section should contain guidelines to assist in that.
Furthermore, it is often helpful to do the same when the players simply cannot remember a rule, to avoid slowing down play while someone looks it up.
And lastly, remember that all the rules contained in this book are guidelines and suggestions.
Feel free to change them all that you want!
The most important thing is that everyone is having fun.

\section{Tests}

Tests are the dice rolls used to determine the outcome of an action when there is element of chance and risk involved.
Several of the rules in this chapter and others will specify the appropriate Test to make with a particular action, but the GM should be calling for other kinds of Tests whenever appropriate as well.
