\chapter{Willing}
\chaplabel{generic-magic}

Willing is the most raw and versatile application of a witch's magic.
Known to many layfolk as sorcery or spellcraft, it is the art of making something true simply by willing it hard enough.
Most willing is performed without any of the accoutrements that accompany other forms of magic, and it doesn't follow the prescribed formulae of rites and brews.
This makes it the weakest form of magic in some ways, but its flexibility and ease of access more than make up for it.
So much so that every witch knows at least the basics.

Like any witchcraft, Willing is something anyone can do if they know how.
But there is a knack to it.
It requires that the witch not only \emph{want} something to be the case, but \emph{believe} that it already is.
That she outright refuses to accept any possibility that it might not, in fact, be the case.
It involves willfully deceiving not only oneself, but also the the very universe.
Most people would never even think to try it, but it is among the first things any aspiring witch must learn.
