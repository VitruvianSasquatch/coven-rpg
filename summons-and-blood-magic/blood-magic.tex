	\capital{\materialref{blood}} is the most powerful \materialref{taglock}.
	With enough of it, you can forge an even stronger {\symlink}.
	
	When you soak a \materialref{poppet} or \materialref{effigy} in a creature's \materialref{blood}, you may establish a {\symlink} to that creature as an {\action}.
	This link is stronger than the link established by \featref{symlink-taglock}: effects that would {\stress} or destroy it take effect normally.
	Soaking a typical hand-sized \materialref{poppet} or \materialref{effigy} typically requires 1 dose of blood, but larger {\symbols} might require more.
