\feat[sympathetic-magic]{Blood Binding}{symlink-blood}{10}{
	\skillref[1]{sympathetic-magic},
	\featref{symlink-taglock}
}{
	\capital{\materialref{blood}} is the most powerful \materialref{taglock}.
	With enough of it, you can forge an even stronger {\symlink}.
	
	When you soak a \materialref{poppet} or \materialref{effigy} in a creature's \materialref{blood}, you may establish a {\symlink} to that creature as an {\action}.
	Unlike \featref{symlink-taglock}, this creates a {\standardsymlink}.
	Soaking a typical hand-sized \materialref{poppet} or \materialref{effigy} typically requires 1 dose of blood, but larger {\symbols} might require more.

\feat[sympathetic-magic]{A Drop of Binding}{symlink-blood-2}{10}{
	\skillref[2]{sympathetic-magic},
	\featref{symlink-taglock}
}{
	\emph{Soaking} a {\symbol} in \materialref{blood}, while potent, is a little wasteful.
	You can use \featref{symlink-blood} with only a drop of the target's \materialref{blood}.
