\section{Step Zero: Character Concept}

The most important part of a character is the concept.
Who is your character, what does she do?
You can try to flesh this all out now, or fill it in as you work through character creation.
Make sure your character is somebody you will enjoy roleplaying.

Also make sure your witch fits into the coven; discuss this with your players and your GM.
It can be quite painful for everyone involved playing an unscrupulous necromancer in a coven of saccharine healers, or vice versa.
The GM should provide some idea of the tone intended for the game, to avoid this sort of trouble.
Diversity can also be good: make sure you know what you're letting yourselves in for if everybody in the group wants to play a potion-brewer.

\section{Step One: Attributes}

Attributes are a witch's broad, innate capabilities.
Is she skinny and lithe or broad and well-muscled, quick-witted or bullheaded, domineering or silver-tongued?

At character creation, you have 15 points to spend on your character's attributes.
Spend these points on each of the six attributes, setting each attribute to between 0 and 4, inclusive.
