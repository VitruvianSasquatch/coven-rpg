\chapter{The Night Curses}

\dropcap{Midnight}.
The witching hour, many say.
But when the sun goes down, and the moon rises, there are far more terrible things abroad than witches.

Rabid beasts with wicked claws, howling their anger at the full moon.
Dead men walking, stalking their prey by night, drinking the blood of the innocent.
Victims of the Night Curses.
{\werewolves} and {\vampires}.

The two curses---{\lycanthrophy} and {\vampirism}---are, truthfully, unrelated.
In fact, while {\lycanthrophy} only afflicts the living, {\vampires} are a variety of undead.
But the two are often treated together, as a result of their similarities.
Both creatures emerge at night: {\vampires} to avoid the sun, and {\werewolves} as they are changed by the moon.
Both can turn innocent, friendly people into bloodthirsty monsters.
And both curses are spread, more or less, by a bite.
