\chapter{Feats of the Night}
\chaplabel{extra-feats-creatures-of-the-night}

\dropcap{In} a world where {\werewolves} and {\vampires} run rife, there are many more who suffer than those directly afflicted by the Night Curses.
Prey to a rabid {\werewolf}; cattle to a thirsty {\vampire}; the friends, family, and neighbours of the afflicted.
There are even those who style themselves as Hunters, dedicating their lives to ridding the world of the Night Curses.
Many of these people get by on hopes, prayers, and, if they're very lucky, a silvered sword.
Some, however, are witches.
And witches are not known to take these matters lying down.

This chapter provides a few feats that may be helpful to {\werewolves}, {\vampires}, and the friends and enemies of these creatures.
However, these feats do not rely upon contracting one curse or another; they may be taken by any witch, whether she is a {\werewolf}, {\vampire}, or neither.

Each of these feats counts as part of an existing discipline, listed alongside the feat name.
If that discipline has a governing skill, the feat provides, and benefits from, the same skill discounts as any other feat in the discipline.
