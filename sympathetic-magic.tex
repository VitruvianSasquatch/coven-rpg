\feat{Taglock Tracing}{identify-taglock}{10}{
	None
}{
	You can touch a taglock and detect who it originates from.
	If you have met the target, you can identify them infallibly.
	
	If you have never met the target, you must make a \testtype{heed}{sympathetic-magic} Test, with higher results giving more information about the target.
	You can only get general information about the target this way, such as height, build, sex, appearance, and occupation.
	You can't get any information about their location, or even whether they are still alive.
