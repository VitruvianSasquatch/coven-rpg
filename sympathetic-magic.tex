Central to the practice of \discref{sympathetic-magic} is the creation and manipulation of {\symbols}.
A {\symbol} is a representation of a creature or object, and by affecting the {\symbol} a witch may cause a mirroring effect upon the target.
Not every \materialref{poppet} or \materialref{effigy} is automatically a {\symbol}.
It must by magically bound to the target by a {\symlink}.

A novice witch can only maintain one {\symlink} at a time.
It's not that maintaining one is particularly arduous; once established, a {\symlink} remains in place indefinitely, even when the witch sleeps.
Rather, two {\symlinks} tend to tangle themselves up, like pieces of string left together in a drawer.
Soon enough, both are totally useless and it takes a pair of shears to separate them.

A {\symlink} by itself does nothing, but a practitioner of \discref{sympathetic-magic} soon learns to use it to transmit numerous things: sensations, physical effects and more.
A {\symlink} doesn't always transmit everything it is capable of transmitting: only what the witch who established it wants it to.
The witch can change what the link transmits at any point she chooses, regardless of proximity to the {\symbol} or the target.
However, she has no particular sense of what is being transmitted by the link, and must watch the {\symbol} or the target if she wants to know.
As such, leaving {\symbols} lying around is a slightly dangerous proposition.

\subsection{Establishing a Sympathetic Link}

Initially, establishing a {\symlink} is a rather involved process.
A novice witch can only establish {\symlinks} to creatures (people or animals), and requires an appropriate \materialref{poppet} or \materialref{effigy} as the {\symbol}.
The ritual that establishes the link requires tying the target and the {\symbol} together with a piece of thread.
It takes five minutes, and must occur in a \circleref{small}.

\section{Feats}

\feat{Taglock Tracing}{identify-taglock}{10}{
	None
}{
	You can touch a taglock and detect who it originates from.
	If you have met the target, you can identify them infallibly.
	
	If you have never met the target, you must make a \testtype{heed}{sympathetic-magic} Test, with higher results giving more information about the target.
	You can only get general information about the target this way, such as height, build, sex, appearance, and occupation.
	You can't get any information about their location, or even whether they are still alive.
}

\feat{Sympathetic Communication}{sympathetic-speak}{15}{
	None
}{
	You can send sounds along a {\symlink}, like a string telephone.
	A creature can hear sounds that originate near its {\symbol}.
	The {\symbol} has a very short range of hearing; speaking through it essentially requires picking it up and holding it near the mouth.
