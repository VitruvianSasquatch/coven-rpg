	None
}{
	\materials{A \circleref{medium} (and no larger), a pinch of sugar, a white-handled knife}
	%Sugar draws things in
	
	Performing this rite takes about fifteen minutes, involving tracing the knife around the perimeter and sprinkling the sugar.
	You may perform the rite from inside or outside the \materialref{ritual-circle}.
	
	At the completion of the rite, the \materialref{ritual-circle} is sealed.
	Objects and creatures inside the \materialref{ritual-circle} cannot pass outside of it, and no magic from inside may affect the outside.
	Light and sound from inside can still leave, however.
	Furthermore, nothing inside the circle may disturb the \materialref{ritual-circle} itself.
	
	This effect lasts 24 hours, but ends early if the \materialref{ritual-circle} is broken.
