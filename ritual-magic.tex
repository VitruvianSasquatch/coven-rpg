\section{Feats}

\feat{Circle of Containment}{circle-contain}{15}{
	None
}{
	\materials{A \circleref{medium} (and no larger), a pinch of sugar, a white-handled knife}
	%Sugar draws things in.
	
	Performing this rite takes about fifteen minutes, involving tracing the knife around the perimeter and sprinkling the sugar.
	You may perform the rite from inside or outside the \materialref{ritual-circle}.
	
	At the completion of the rite, the \materialref{ritual-circle} is sealed.
	Objects and creatures inside the \materialref{ritual-circle} cannot pass outside of it, and no magic from inside may affect the outside.
	Light and sound from inside can still leave, however.
	Air may diffuse slowly across the boundary, preventing suffocation or problems with pressure.
	Furthermore, nothing inside the circle may disturb the \materialref{ritual-circle} itself.
	
	This effect lasts 24 hours, but ends early if the \materialref{ritual-circle} is broken.
	The rite to renew the effect cannot be performed while the effect remains in place.
}

\feat{Circle of Exclusion}{circle-exclude}{15}{
	None
}{
	\materials{A \circleref{medium} (and no larger), a pinch of salt, a black-handled knife}
	%Salt is a preservative, driving foulness away.
	
	This functions as \featref{circle-contain}, except the other way.
	Objects, creatures, and magical effects can pass out of the \materialref{ritual-circle}, but not into it, and the \materialref{ritual-circle} may be disturbed only from the inside.
}

\feat{Circle of Severance}{circle-contain-exclude}{10}{
	\featref{circle-contain},
	\featref{circle-exclude}
}{
	\materials{A \circleref{medium} (and no larger), a pinch of sugar, a pinch of salt, a double-edged knife}
	
	This functions as \featref{circle-contain}, except in both directions.
	Objects, creatures and magical effects cannot pass into or out of the \materialref{ritual-circle}, and the \materialref{ritual-circle} cannot be disturbed in any fashion.
}

\feat{Renew Circle}{circle-protection-renew}{10}{
	\featref{circle-contain} or \featref{circle-exclude}
}{
	You may repeat the rite to establish a \featref{circle-contain}, \featref{circle-exclude} or \featref{circle-contain-exclude} while the effect of one is ongoing.
	You may do so from inside or outside of the \materialref{ritual-circle}.
	The new duration runs from the completion of the repeated rite, though this cannot be used to reduce the remaining duration.
