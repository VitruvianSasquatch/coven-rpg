\section{Feats}

\feat{Circle of Containment}{circle-contain}{15}{
	None
}{
	\materials{A \circleref{medium} (and no larger), a pinch of sugar, a white-handled knife}
	%Sugar draws things in
	
	Performing this rite takes about fifteen minutes, involving tracing the knife around the perimeter and sprinkling the sugar.
	You may perform the rite from inside or outside the \materialref{ritual-circle}.
	
	At the completion of the rite, the \materialref{ritual-circle} is sealed.
	Objects and creatures inside the \materialref{ritual-circle} cannot pass outside of it, and no magic from inside may affect the outside.
	Light and sound from inside can still leave, however.
	Air may diffuse slowly across the boundary, preventing suffocation or problems with pressure.
	Furthermore, nothing inside the circle may disturb the \materialref{ritual-circle} itself.
	
	This effect lasts 24 hours, but ends early if the \materialref{ritual-circle} is broken.
	The rite to renew the effect cannot be performed while the effect remains in place.
}

\feat{Circle of Exclusion}{circle-exclude}{15}{
	None
}{
	\materials{A \circleref{medium} (and no larger), a pinch of salt, a black-handled knife}
	%Salt preserves, keeping something
	
	This functions as \featref{circle-contain}, except the other way.
	Objects, creatures, and magical effects can pass out of the \materialref{ritual-circle}, but not into it, and the \materialref{ritual-circle} may be disturbed only from the inside.
