I'm going to use the dimensions for the casket from this picture:

I'm going to work in inches all the way along, then convert at the end, 'cause that's what everything comes in for graves.

We begin by calculating the area of the casket.
It consists of two trapezia.
The upper trapezium has area:
	(18+26)/2 * 24 = 528
The lower trapezium has area:
	(14+26)/2 * (80-24) = 1120
This gives the coffin a total area of:
	1120 + 528 = 1648

The grave is 6 feet deep, by tradition, 72 inches.
This gives the volume of the grave:
	1648 * 72 = 118656

Converting 118656 cubic inches to cubic metres:
	1.94442347
Nearly precisely 2, quite conveniently.
