\feat{Mind over Magic}{foil-magic}{
	None
}{
	For all the magic circles and burning incense, magic ultimately comes from the mind.
	Not only do you know this, but you know \emph{how to exploit it}.
	
	If you can convince a practitioner of magic that their magic won't work, then it won't.

\feat{Doubt \& Despair}{foil-magic-2}{
	\featref{foil-magic}
}{
	Under your tender care, even the smallest seed of doubt can flourish into a blossoming tree of failure.
	
	If you can make a practitioner so much as doubt the efficacy of their magic, or their own ability to work it, then the magic will either fail to work or, at the GM's option, backfire.
