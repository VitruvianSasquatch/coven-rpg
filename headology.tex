	For all the magic circles and burning incense, magic ultimately comes from the mind.
	Not only do you know this, but you know \emph{how to exploit it}.
	
	If you can convince a practitioner of magic that their magic won't work, then it won't.

\feat{Doubt \& Despair}{foil-magic-2}{25}{
	\featref{foil-magic}
}{
	Under your tender care, even the smallest seed of doubt can flourish into a blossoming tree of failure.
	
	If you can make a practitioner so much as doubt the efficacy of their magic, or their own ability to work it, then the magic will either fail to work or, at the GM's option, backfire.

}{
	If you can convince your foes that what you wield is a weapon, their flesh will believe you.
	You may treat an item you wield or throw as a Knife, Hand Weapon or Thrown Weapon (depending on its size and whether you're throwing it) if you can convince the target that it can cut (or otherwise deal damage) like one.
	A demonstration against an inanimate object, or another foe, will often suffice.
	Even your bare hands can cut like Knives if you convince your foes that they can.
