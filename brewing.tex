	You know how to make a drink that'll really put hairs on a man's chest.
	Or a woman's, at that.
	This potion is made in a still, instead of a cauldron.
	
	\materials{Alcohol, \herbref[Apple]{2}}
	
	The drinker gains 1 \attref{might} for a few hours, and loses 2 \attref{wit} for the same duration.

\feat{Healing Salves}{brewing-healing}{15}{
	\skillref[1]{brewing}
}{
	You know a wide range of minor poultices, salves and remedies for cuts, bruises and other physical injuries.
	As long as you have access to a reasonable supply of various \herbrefplural{2}, and time to chew up poultices, you may use your \skillref{brewing} skill in place of your \skillref{healing} skill on Tests to heal people and creatures of most physical injuries.
	Setting broken bones and performing surgery still requires \skillref{healing}.
	
	Similarly, you may use your \skillref{brewing} rank in place of your \skillref{healing} rank when determining the \secrefraw{damage} healed by a patient during a day of rest.
