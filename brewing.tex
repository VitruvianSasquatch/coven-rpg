	You know a wide range of minor poultices, salves and remedies for cuts, bruises and other physical injuries.
	As long as you have access to a reasonable supply of various \herbrefplural{2}, and time to chew up poultices, you may use your \skillref{brewing} skill in place of your \skillref{healing} skill on Tests to heal people and creatures of most physical injuries.
	Setting broken bones and performing surgery still requires \skillref{healing}.
	
	Similarly, you may use your \skillref{brewing} rank in place of your \skillref{healing} rank when determining the \secrefraw{damage} healed by a patient during a day of rest.
