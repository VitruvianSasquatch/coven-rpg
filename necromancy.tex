	None
}{
	When a soul departs our world for the next, its passage disrupts the Veil between worlds.
	A witch who knows what to look for can feel this disruption.
	
	You can feel where people have died, though this sense is damped by both distance and time.
	If you pass through the actual position of the death, you'll notice for up to about two weeks after it occurred.
	You automatically sense a death in the same room only for a few days after it's happened, and in the same house for only about a day.
	However, a Test can reveal slightly older or more distant deaths, if you are searching for them.
	You can't gain any information about the identity of the victim or the cause of death.
	
	Locations of mass or repeated death can leave their traces lingering for much longer.
	The site of a battlefield or sacrificial altar may be felt for many years after.
