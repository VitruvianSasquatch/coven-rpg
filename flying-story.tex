Today was not going well for Linda Greene.
It had started out alright.
A brisk walk in the frosty air at sunrise, a quick trip up to the castle to drop off a couple of poultices for the servants there.
The cook had even given her a big side of braised ham for her help.
But things had gone downhill pretty quickly when the warty old crone had strolled in and started turning people into frogs.

Now here she was, speeding over the mountaintops, hair and cloak whipped back by the frozen wind, and a crazy old hag hot on her tail.
The crone had a wicked-looking knife clutched between her teeth.
Been screaming that she was going to gut the king with it, or somthing unpleasant like that.
Well, the king was safe for now, even if he was croaking rather indignantly.
Linda had stuffed him down her blouse so his now-cold-blooded majesty wouldn't freeze in the mountain air.
It did explain the indignancy, perhaps, but Linda had bigger problems on her mind.
The hag was gaining on her.

Linda leant right forwards and threw the stick into a dive.
She picked up speed as she shed altitude, but the hag quickly followed suit.
Her feet brushed the snow as she skimmed down the far side of the mountain

\dots %TODO: Write the middle of the chase.

She wasn't the best flyer in the world, she knew that.
She wasn't even the best in the kingdom; young Wren up Salwich way could fly circles around her.
And this hag, too, was clearly better than her.
But the problem with being the best was that there were some things you didn't actually get to practice that much.
Some things that Linda, who was the first to admit that her reach often exceeded her grasp, got to practice all too often.

%TODO: Stall the sticks, and have Linda recover. The hag falls into a snowdrift.
