\section{Skills}

%TODO: Intro fluff paragraph about the skill of a witch.

%TODO: Recap how skills affect dice rolled for Tests, and how not every Test has an applicable skill.

Each skill is governed by one of the disciplines of witchcraft, and a witch typically improves her skill alongside the relevant discipline.
Some skills are nonetheless general skills, pertaining to things any witch might find herself doing.
Others are of little use to a witch who does not practice such a discipline, although they can often be used to identify, and sometimes to counteract, the effects from it.

A list of the skills available to a witch, alongside their governing discipline and examples of their use, is provided below.
Details on increasing skills can be found in the chapters on each discipline in \partref{disciplines}.

\newcommand\govdisc[1]{Governing discipline: #1} %TODO: Make these link to the relevant chapter, and insert the title of that chapter automatically.

\subsection{Botany}
\govdisc{Botany}

Used to raise crops and herbs in a witch's garden, find them out in the forest, or identify a fishy-looking leaf.

\subsection{Broomcraft}
\govdisc{Broomcraft}

Used by a witch on a broomstick, whether she's settling in for a cross-country flight, showing off with a barrel roll, or pulling a stalled stick out of a deep dive.

\subsection{Deceive}
\govdisc{Headology} %TODO: Rename

Many witches make it a rule not to lie.
That doesn't mean they always need to tell the whole truth, so this can still be a useful skill for them.

\subsection{Perception}
\govdisc{Divination}

Used by the uninitiated to see their present surroundings: to spot things out of place or to pick out details at a distance.
Also used to see the past and future, and places many miles away, for those who know how.

\subsection{Necromancy}
\govdisc{Necromancy}

Used to pervert the natural order and bring the dead back to life.
Also used to send them on again, if hitting them over the head with a big stick won't suffice.

\subsection{Weaponry}
\govdisc{} %TODO

Used for everything from stabbing people with a concealed knife to clonking them over the head with a hefty staff, or even slugging them with a mean right hook.
