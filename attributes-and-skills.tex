%TODO: Intro fluff paragraph about the skill of a witch.

%TODO: Recap how skills affect dice rolled for Tests, and how not every Test has an applicable skill.

A witch's skills can be divided into two categories.
The first consists of general skills, pertaining to things any witch might find herself doing.
The second consists of a witch's skills in her particular disciplines of magic.
These skills are of little use to a witch who does not practice such a discipline, although they can often be used to identify, and sometimes to counteract, the effects from it.

A list of the skills available to a witch, alongside examples of their use, is provided below.

\subsection{Botany}

Used to raise crops and herbs in a witch's garden, find them out in the forest, or identify a fishy-looking leaf.

\subsection{Flying}

Used by a witch on a broomstick, whether she's settling in for a cross-country flight, showing off with a barrel roll, or pulling a stalled stick out of a deep dive.

\subsection{Necromancy}

Used to pervert the natural order and bring the dead back to life.
Also used to send them on again, if hitting them over the head with a big stick won't suffice.

\subsection{Weaponry}

Used for everything from stabbing people with a concealed knife to clonking them over the head with a hefty staff, or even slugging them with a mean right hook.
