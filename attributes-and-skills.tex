\section{Attributes}

Attributes are a character's broad, innate capabilities.
They represent physical capacity and natural talent.
That is not to say they can't be improved; one can grow muscle through exercise and the brain is no different; but such improvement represents a more significant investment than picking up a new skill.
A character has six attributes: Might, Grace, Wit, Will, Charm and Presence.
For human characters, these range from 0 to 5, with 2 as the average for a human.
Non-human characters may have attributes outside this range.

A summary of these attributes is provided below, along with examples of using the attribute.
Note that many of the example Tests would be accompanied by an appropriate skill.

\subsection{Might}

Might represents physical strength, endurance and resilience.
It's used to lift things, smash things, resist diseases and endure hard labour, to put the hurt on people and to resist having the hurt put back on you.
Might is the attribute you use when rolling damage with melee weapons, and also determines the amount of damage required to put you down.
It can also prove useful when a brewer or botanist feeds you something you shouldn't have eaten.
Lastly, powerful legs let you run faster.

%This table seems unhelpful, on second thoughts.

\subsection{Grace}

Grace represents agility, dexterity and reflexes.
It's used to dodge swords, manoeuvre broomsticks, do backflips, dance waltzes, and hastily scratch runic circles into the floor without smudging them and letting the demons in.
Grace determines how hard you are to hit with a weapon or a fist and also contributes toward your speed.

\subsection{Wit}

Wit represents intelligence, memory and awareness.
It's used to recall knowledge, solve puzzles, spot lies, and ensure no detail escapes your notice.
Wit is the key attribute for many forms of magic, used to memorise and understand spells, recipes and rituals.

%TODO: Table.

\subsection{Will}

Will represents courage, dedication and conviction.
It's used to stand your ground, resist the influence of others, remain unfazed in embarassing situations, and push onwards in the face of adversity.
Will influences your pain threshold and is used to resist curses and mental influence, mundane or magical.

\subsection{Charm}

Charm represents eloquence, wile and comeliness.
It's used to persuade, deceive or seduce people, to smarm your way into their good graces, and to imply things without outright saying them.

\subsection{Presence}

Presence represents force of personality, air of authority and personal magnetism.
It's used to draw people's attention, boss them around, and make them wet themselves in terror.

\section{Skills}

%TODO: Intro fluff paragraph about the skill of a witch.

%TODO: Recap how skills affect dice rolled for Tests, and how not every Test has an applicable skill.

A witch's skills can be divided into two categories.
The first consists of general skills, pertaining to things any witch might find herself doing.
The second consists of a witch's skills in her particular disciplines of magic.
These skills are normally of little use to a witch who does not practice such a discipline, although they can often be used to identify, and sometimes to counteract, the effects from it.

A list of the skills available to a witch, and examples of their use, is provided below.
If a skill corresponds to a particular discipline of magic, it can be increased by feats found in the appropriate chapter of \partref{disciplines}.
Otherwise, it can be increased by general feats. %TODO: Where to find these.

\newcommand\govdisc[1]{Governing discipline: #1} %TODO: Make these link to the relevant chapter, and insert the title of that chapter automatically.

\subsection{Botany}

Used to raise crops and herbs in a witch's garden, find them out in the forest, or identify a fishy-looking leaf.

\subsection{Flying}
\govdisc{Broomcraft}

Used by a witch on a broomstick, whether she's settling in for a cross-country flight, showing off with a barrel roll, or pulling a stalled stick out of a deep dive.

\subsection{Deceive}

Many witches make it a rule not to lie.
That doesn't mean they always need to tell the whole truth, so this can still be a useful skill for them.

\subsection{Perception}

Used by the uninitiated to see their present surroundings: to spot things out of place or to pick out details at a distance.
Also used to see the past and future, and places many miles away, for those who know how.

\subsection{Necromancy}
\govdisc{Necromancy}

Used to pervert the natural order and bring the dead back to life.
Also used to send them on again, if hitting them over the head with a big stick won't suffice.

\subsection{Weaponry}

Used for everything from stabbing people with a concealed knife to clonking them over the head with a hefty staff, or even slugging them with a mean right hook.
