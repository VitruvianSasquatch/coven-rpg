\section{Extraordinary Herbs}

Many \herbtypeplural{5} possess some level of mobility or the ability to defend themselves; enough to qualify them as a creature.
A witch with \skillref[3]{botany} is assumed to have enough tricks and experience to keep these herbs under control, but someone else wandering into her garden might be less lucky.
The GM can also use these as inspiration for an adventure, or perhaps a short scene when a witch leaves her garden untended for too long, and has to bring it back into shape.
