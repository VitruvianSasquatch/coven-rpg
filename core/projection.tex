\chapter{Projection}
\chaplabel{projection}

\discref{projection} is a strictly mental discipline.
It features none of the circles and gestures of \discref{ritual-magic}, nor even the physical cues that often accompany \discref{willing}.
In fact, with her mind gone, an unskilled witch leaves her body totally catatonic.

But as much as it fails to engage the body, \discref{projection} engages every part of the mind.
A witch uses her \attref{heed} to sense the minds of others; her \attref{wit} to reach them, to probe them, to find the cracks and leverage them; and her \attref{will} to ram another mind, to shunt it from its body and replace it with her own.
Lastly, her \attref{wit} is important in returning to her own body.

\section{The Mental Realm}
\seclabel{the-mental-realm}

The {\mentalrealm} is not truly a different realm, so much as it is a different way of experiencing our own one.
\discref{projection} is the ability to cast one's mind out into this realm, and to operate within it.

The {\mentalrealm} is not experienced with any of the normal senses, tied as these senses are to organs such as the eyes, ears and skin.
But if one had to describe it, it might go something like this:

Image a vast, grey plain.
It stretches away forever in all directions.
\emph{All} directions, for there is no ground, no sky.
You do not fall, just float.
There is no up, no down, no north, south, east or west.
Not unless you brought them with you.

And you had better hope you did, because there are no landmarks.
Everything is pervaded by a cold, grey fog.
It is thick.
So thick that you would be wading through it, if you still had legs.
You'd hardly see your own hand in front of face, even if you still had one.

Only one thing shines through the fog.
It is dim, so dim, but it is close.
In fact, it seems to be inside of you, so far as there is a `you' to be inside.
It is you.
There is not much there now.
Your body, catatonic, rigid.
The barest traces of mind you have left behind, keeping you breathing, your heart beating.

As you adjust to the gloom, you strain the eyes you do not have and peer deep into the fog.
The faintest hints of light shine through.
They move, dance, and play in the distance.
Some shine brighter, some softer.
They are the minds of others, still living in the realm you have left behind.

You could reach out and touch them, if you wanted.
Just one quick step over there, pushing your way into the fog.
But you can still feel the light beside, inside of you.
It is so dim.
If you stepped away, would you be able to find it again?
Or would you be lost in the fog forever?

\subsection{Using the Mental Realm}
\seclabel{using-the-mental-realm}

A witch may enter the {\mentalrealm} by taking a \featref{projection-start}.
Her body is left catatonic and helpless, although still alive and breathing, while her mind departs.
She enters the {\mentalrealm} with her mind safely beside her body, able to return to it at any point she chooses.

Even a novice entering the {\mentalrealm} can sense nearby minds.
The fog that fills the realm prevents this sense from reaching far.
Minds in the same room can be sensed automatically, while a \testtype{heed}{projection} might extend the sense to fill a house or more.
Vague attributes of the minds---whether they belong to an animal, a human or a familiar---are obvious.
Gleaning the actual identity of a mind requires a Test.

Occasionally, spirits are also detectable in the {\mentalrealm}; in fact, many exist solely there.
Beware: not all are benevolent.
Similarly, the minds of other witches performing \discref{projection} are present and noticable.
This spirits and other minds are detected and may be identified just like the minds of the living, but no form of communication is possible.

Moving within the {\mentalrealm} is easy.
Navigating is not.
Time and space work strangely, allowing a mind to shift itself miles in a mere moment.
However, the same effect allows an untrained or careless mind to shift itself a long way out of place in a mere moment.
Furthermore, there is no sense of location or direction, and no landmarks besides the minds themselves.
A mind can shift itself to any other mind that it can sense, and follow it around as it moves, but anything else is pure guesswork.
Such guesswork and navigation uses \testtype{wit}{projection} Tests.

\subsection{Lifelines}
\seclabel{mental-lifeline}

A mind is always connected to its own body by a {\lifeline}.
This {\lifeline} serves two purposes.

Firstly, the mind, departed as it may be, still depends on the brain for survival.
If a witch's body is killed, her {\lifeline} is severed, and her mind dies too.
This occurs regardless of where her mind is, even if she is {\possessing} someone else.
As such, she must return to her body periodically to eat and drink, just as usual.
Furthermore, \discref{projection} is not a restful exercise.
A witch still suffers sleep deprivation if she does not return to her body and enjoy natural sleep at the usual rate.

The second use of a {\lifeline} is equally essential to a witch who wishes to make use of \discref{projection}.
While {\lifelines} are imperceptible to the untrained, a skilled witch comes to detect her {\lifeline} and follow it back to her body.
The distance at which she can do this is limited---the {\lifeline} stetches thinner and grows harder to detect as she moves from her body---but inside that distance she is in no danger of getting lost, and may return to her own body in an instant.

A witch who has not yet learned to sense her {\lifeline} ought to remain where she can still sense her own mind.
As a novice, this range is only a handful of metres, severely limiting activites.

\section{Possession}
\seclabel{possession}

Besides getting lost, another major risk of \discref{projection} is {\possession}.
The body a witch leaves behind when she enters the {\mentalrealm} is not just physically helpless, but vulnerable to mental intrusion.
Thankfully, most spirits don't have the skill or the power to invade even an undefended mind.
But every so often, a witch might return to her body to find it occupied by something else.

However, {\possession} is also a power that a witch skilled in \discref{projection} can use to her own advantage.
Such a witch learns to take up residence in an unoccupied body, or even to invade and displace an existing occupant.

A displaced occupant always finds themselves in the {\mentalrealm}, even if they haven't the skill to enter it willingly.
This comes as a frightful shock to the uninitiated, but most have the basic instinct to remain close to the nearest light---the mind now possessing their own body---until such a time as they might return to it.

\subsection{Possessed Creatures}

A {\possessed} creature uses the body's \attref{might} and \attref{grace}, but the {\possessing} mind's other attributes, skills and feats.
The {\possessing} mind has full control of the body, and may retain it indefinitely.

However, the body's owner always has the strongest claim to it, and may attempt to displace a {\possessing} mind.
To do so, it must be adjacent in the {\mentalrealm}, and trying to force its way back in.
Whenever the {\possessing} creature is shocked in some fashion, such as by {\damage}, a slap to the face, a dunk in icy water or the revelation of a terrible secret, the body's original owner gets an attempt to reassert control.
She makes a \testtype{will}{projection} Test, opposed by the {\possessing} mind's \testtype{will}{projection} Test.
If she succeeds, she displaces the {\possessing} mind back into the {\mentalrealm}, and regains control of her body.

\section{Feats}

\feat{Step Outside}{projection-start}{10}{
	None
}{
	You may enter the {\mentalrealm} by closing your eyes and meditating for a minute.
}

\feat{Stand in Absentia}{projection-remain}{10}{
	\skillref[1]{projection},
	\featref{projection-start}
}{
	When you enter the {\mentalrealm}, you may leave your body standing or sitting upright, and your eyes open.
	It won't do much to fool people---your eyes glaze over or stare into the middle distance, and you'll fall over if someone knocks you---but they might not notice if they're not paying attention either, or if you're not facing them.
}

\feat{Dreaming}{projection-sleep}{10}{
	\featref{projection-start}
}{
	You have trained your body to rest in your mind's absence.
	While your mind is in the {\mentalrealm} (or {\possessing} a creature), and your body is unoccupied and resting, it may sleep.
	Such sleep can heal {\damage} as usual, and remove {\exhaustion} that affects \attref{might} or \attref{grace}.
	However, while your mind does not rest, you cannot recover from {\exhaustion} affecting your other attributes, and you still suffer sleep deprivation as usual.
}

\feat{Piercing the Fog}{projection-sense}{15}{
	\skillref[1]{projection},
	\featref{projection-start}
}{
	You are becoming accustomed to the fog of the {\mentalrealm}, and can sense things deeper within it.
	You can detect minds out to about 100 metres.
}

\feat{Banishing the Fog}{projection-sense-2}{20}{
	\skillref[2]{projection},
	\featref{projection-sense}
}{
	The fog of the {\mentalrealm} does not truly exist; it is a defence the mind automatically casts against the stark, unending void suddenly thrown before it.
	Few have realised this, but with the realisation you have succeeded in banashing it entirely.
	
	Inside the {\mentalrealm}, your senses are unimpeded.
	You can sense a human mind from as far away as you could see a human, about 3 kilometres.
	Smaller minds might not be detectable from quite such a distance.
	But with no horizon to impede the view, you can sense a larger mind, or a crowd, from much further off.
}

\feat{Sense Lifeline}{lifeline}{10}{
	\featref{projection-start}
}{
	You may detect your {\lifeline} when within the {\mentalrealm}, and use it return to your own body, as long as you remain within about 100 metres.
}

\feat{Shape of a Mind}{projection-read-mind}{15}{
	\featref{projection-start}
}{
	The simple shape of a creature's mind in the {\mentalrealm} can betray a surprising amount.
	When in the {\mentalrealm}, you can glean this information by merely your own mind against its.
	Firstly, you know the creature's identity.
	This is not their \emph{name}, or any such concrete information.
	But it is enough to recognise them if you know them, and normally to realise that they are not who they say they are.
	
	Secondly, you can feel the creature's emotions.
	This is not simply a vague impression, but a very particular sense which you can feel varying moment-to-moment.
	However, the GM might call for a Test to detect better-hidden emotions, such as a twinge of guilt overwhelmed by a great sense of triumph.
	
	It is true that emotions often just be read on a person's face, without risking a trip to the {\mentalrealm}, however it is far harder for a liar to control their mind than their face.
	Animal's faces, too, can prove harder to interpret than their minds.
	This technique can be used very effectively in concert with an accomplice to direct questions at the target.
}

\feat{Borrow Sight}{projection-sight-reading}{15}{
	\featref{projection-mind-reading}
}{
	They say that the eyes are the windows to the soul.
	That you can read a person's thoughts be staring into their eyes.
	What most people forget is that windows both ways.
	By peering into someone's mind, you can see out of their eyes.
	
	While touching a creature's mind in the {\mentalrealm}, you can see what it sees.
	You don't have any control over where it points it eyes, of course.
	As such, anything it hasn't noticed or isn't paying attention to is somewhat indistinct.
	Conversely, this does make it rather easy to tell what the creature is paying attention to.
}

\feat{Mental Eavesdropping}{projection-read-mind-2}{20}{
	\featref{projection-read-mind}
}{
	While the shape of a creature's mind betrays its emotions, listening to its \emph{thoughts} requires a slightly deeper probing.
	While touching a creature's mind in the {\mentalrealm}, you can listen to its thoughts.
	This isn't an active mind reading so much as a passive mind eavesdropping.
	You can only hear its active train of thought, the words running through its head whenever you happen to be listening.
	If it is speaking, these are normally the words it is saying.
	
	You can only understand these thoughts if the creature is thinking in a language you understand, which tends to limit the ability to humans and other intelligent creatures.
	%TODO: Reference a druidcraft feat that lets you understand animal spech/thought.
	Furthermore, a rigidly controlled and disciplined mind can prevent certain thoughts from slipping into this internally vocalised stream, if it has reason to suspect it is being eavesdropped upon.
	There are even rumours of witches who have fooled mental eavesdroppers by intentionally lying in their own thoughts.
	%TODO: Add feats for this sort of fooling? Feats that don't actually require the ability to Project at all?
