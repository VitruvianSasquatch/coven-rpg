\storychapter{A Day at the Market}

Tuesday in Salwich.
You could barely hear youself think over the racket in the village green.
Shuffling and bellowing, hawking and squawking.

It was the only day of the week that Wren came came down to the village on foot.
She'd never liked flying with a heavy weight; it cramped her style.
And the burlap sack she managed to fill every market day certainly counted.
