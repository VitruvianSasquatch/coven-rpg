\dropcap{The} battle was near wrapped up now; the sun about an hour above the horizon.
The defenders had sallied out with great success, crippling the invaders' catapult before it could be brought to bear.
The invaders were routed now, but casualties had been high on both sides.

Ivy Shotworth bustled back and forth in the castle's foyer.
She'd set up a sort of field hospital; injured men laid out on what rugs were available, or on the bare flagstones.
More were coming in quickly.
Most of them hobbling, some being carried.
One of the maids was helping with triage.
One of the patients---a leg wound that'd be alright in a week, tops---was keeping a couple of irons hot in the fire.
She'd had to use them too often already.
Those were three limbs that their owners wouldn't be seeing again in a hurry.

Ivy hurried to the next patient.
Young Ned, the blacksmith's son, now missing a finger from his left hand.
But he'd been lucky; it was a clean cut, and the next finger was barely nicked.
She sloshed some of the contents of her hip flask over the stump, then bound it tight with a strip of cloth.
That'd do for now, but she'd have to come back to it later.
Hopefully whoever'd kept his blade sharp enough for a cut like that had kept it clean too.

A bark came from behind her as she moved down the line of patients.
Monty was standing by the door, whining quietly and indicating outside with his head.
He was a bloodhound; a big one.
He'd gone out to help find wounded, and it seemed someone had turned up.
Ivy exchanged a quick glance with him, then spun around and shouted down the hall.

``Grover!
Bit of help here!''
The din in the foyer quieted down for a moment as everyone turned to look---patients, soldiers, and maids.
Grover broke off his conversation and hurried over.
She beckoned to indicate he should follow her, then headed outside after Monty.
Grover followed wordlessly.

The pointed hat was useful like that.
No hesitation, no awkward questions.
Sure, she'd earned the respect; cures, midwifing, even surgery.
She made herself more than useful around here.
But the hat was a constant reminder.
It'd make itself useful for what was coming, too.

Monty led them around the back of the castle, where two men lay.
It looked like they'd been caught away from most of the fighting, doing who knows what, when they'd run into one another.
One was definitely dead; he had the other man's sword sticking out both sides of his chest.
The other man---wearing the invaders' colours---had a nasty gash down his flank.
He was lying on the ground, clearly unconscious, but his chest was rising and falling.

Ivy strode to the breathing man's legs and bent down, hooking her arms under his knees.
``You get his shoulders.''

Grover gave her a look.
\emph{Are we really doing this?} it asked.
\emph{Are we really helping the enemy?}

But he didn't actually vocalise it.
It was the hat that did that.
That, and the look she gave him back.
It said, in no uncertain terms, \emph{Yes.}

Between them, they carried the man back into the castle.
