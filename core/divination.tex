\discipline{Divination}{divination}{Seer}{Seers}

\dropcapdiscref{divination} is the art of seeing, hearing, and otherwise sensing in ways that are not normally possible.
Many witches consider it to be a very narrow and limited discipline.
In many ways, they are right.
It certainly lacks the versatility of \discref{willing}.
In fact, it lacks \discrefpossessive{willing} ability to affect the world at all.

Rather, \practitioners{divination}---as the practitioners of \discref{divination} are called---tend to rely on enhanced knowledge and awareness.
It's all very well, they say, having the power to crush a man beneath a ton of rock, but which man to crush?
Was he the one who did the crime?
And where's he run off to now?
With {\foretelling}, it may be possible to stop him before he even commits the crime.
After all, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and a single arrow can change the world if you know just where to put it.

Despite its seemingly narrow focus, \discref{divination} still covers a fairly wide gamut of abilities.
The simplest just enhance an existing sense, allowing a witch to see in the dark, for example.
Some, such as \featref{divination-self}, grant an entirely new sense.
Perhaps the most interesting, however, are \featref{scrying}, \featref{hindsight}, and \featref{foresight}.
These allow the witch to see distant locations, the past, and even the future.

In terms of the necessary equipment, \discref{divination} sits between the extremes of \discref{willing} and \discref{ritual-magic}.
Much of it, particularly simple enhancements to a witch's senses, requires nothing beyond a witch's eyes or eyes, and sometimes not even those.
In fact, many of these abilities require essentially no ongoing effort from the witch; once she knows the trick of it, it's as easy as opening her eyes.
Some \discref{divination}, however---particularly sensing distant locations---requires a lot more concentration and equipment.
\featref{scrying} requires a surface to look through, and several abilities require an object to focus upon, to find the right time or location to sense.

\attref{heed} is the most important attribute in \discref{divination}.
The discipline is entirely about extending one's awareness, and a witch who is blind to her own surroundings in the first place is going to have a hard time looking any further afield.

\section{Foretelling}
\seclabel{foretelling}

For many witches, telling the future is the most enticing part of \discref{divination}.
It is, however, the trickiest.

In truth, nobody has ever managed to see their own future.
To know one's own fate, but to do \emph{nothing} to avoid it, is a level of self-discipline beyond any \practitioner{divination} the world has yet seen.
And without that self-discipline, the future is simply inscrutable---it seems almost to be defending itself against change.

But witches wouldn't be witches if they hadn't found a way to cheat.
You can't see your own future, but you can see the next closest thing.
So foretelling, such as it is practiced, is a matter of forking the stream of time, of tossing a rock into the flow and sending it thundering down two different channels.
There is a moment in every foretelling ritual, or spell, where the \practitioner{divination} goes two ways.
On one branch, she completes the ritual.
On the other, she stops abruptly halfway through, stands up, and goes about her life none the wiser.
It is the world of the second \practitioner{divination} that the first \practitioner{divination} sees.

Most \practitioners{divination} treat this as a metaphor, of course.
They've never \emph{actually} abandoned the ritual halfway through, no matter how many times they've seen themselves do it.
But some do wonder if those copies of themselves exist out there somewhere, even the ones they've seen die.

\subsection{The World Foretold}

All in all, a \practitioner{divination} performing foretelling sees visions of the world as it would turn out if she did not perform this foretelling.
So long as she does not interfere, she may assume that things will proceed, for the most part, the same.
But, as she changes more things, the worlds will diverge further, until her predictions become useless.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that sitting still in a dark room, doing nothing, doesn't mean a \practitioner{divination} is not interfering.
In the world where she performed no divination, the one she has peered in on, she likely acted, going out and doing whatever she normally did.
By sitting still in this world, she leaves out the results of those actions, probably rendering her predictions inaccurate quite quickly.

As such, the best way to keep predictions accurate for as long as possible is to act as though she never made them in the first place, going about as though she were blind to the future.
It will never work indefinitely, but she might be able to keep it up for a while.

\subsection{Foretelling \& the Metagame}

Telling the future is tricky not only for a witch, in character, but also for the GM running the game.
Giving good visions requires the GM to predict how events would play out, assuming the \practitioner{divination} had no foreknowledge.
This requires more planning than some GMs might want to do.

Furthermore, it often requires predicting how the player's characters would act, which can cause problems.
The GM is free to ask the players themselves, if that won't give away any plot details that the vision itself won't.
It can even be fun to play out the world where the \practitioner{divination} did not perform her foretelling, before jumping back to the point of the foretelling with the \practitionerpossessive{divination} new knowledge and playing again from there.
That can grow tedious, of course---it should be used sparingly, and with the agreement of everyone at the table.

Most importantly, both the players and the GM should be understanding that telling the future is tricky business.
Everyone should be willing to forgive mistakes, and to try and resolve everything coherently.
And if everything is just too much, the GM can request that players simply avoid the more troublesome feats.
Even then, feats such as \featref{divination-initiative} and \featref{divination-dodge} allow for witches who can see the future without requiring the GM to invent visions.

\subsection{Foretelling as a Plot Device}

Prophecies and visions are an ancient staple of myths and legends, as well as contemporary literature.
GMs should feel free to use foretelling as a device in creating plots for the game.
This may use the visions provided by a player character's feats, other omens or visions imparted upon a \practitioner{divination}, or a non-player \practitioner{divination}.

One aspect to play with as part of a plot is the assumption that no \practitioner{divination} can see their own future.
Just because no \practitioner{divination} has had the self-discipline to manage it yet, doesn't mean that it is impossible.
Any plot violating this assumption must be very carefully executed, to avoid taking agency away from the players, but can be very effective if it is done well.
Just remember that witches are notorious cheats---even predestined events are only fixed to the extent that they've been seen, and can always be staged.

	This feat does not literally give you any extra eyes, and only works as long as you can see normally.

	If you have never met the target, you must make a \testtype{heed}{divination} Test, with higher results giving more information about the target.
	You can only get general information about the target this way, such as height, build, sex, appearance, and occupation.
	You can't get any information about their location, or even whether they are still alive.

	When you touch a \materialref{taglock}, you can find the person or creature it originates from.

	This comes in the form of distance and direction---you can navigate to them easily, but that they are, for example, in the castle requires you to know the location of the castle, and figure out that's the location they're in.
	If they are moving, you can feel their position changing as they do.
}

\feat{Scrying}{scrying}{10}{
	\noprereq

	You can use a \materialref{crystal-ball} to scry.
	You can scry on any location within 1 kilometre, but must be able to estimate distance and direction the place you are scrying.
	This is easy enough for any place you've taken a simple route to or from, but it might be hard to scry on the middle of a maze using this.
	\featref{divination-self} allows you to perfectly place any location you have been, and \featref{divination-taglock-location} lets you place a person.
	
	Scrying essentially forms a sensor, hanging in the air at the target location---although the ``sensor'' is invisible, intangible, and doesn't actually exist in any real sense.
	While scrying, you can move the sensor at a strolling pace, in all three dimensions and unimpeded by walls.
	It must stay within your 1 kilometre scrying radius.
	
	It takes about a minute of concentration on the \materialref{crystal-ball} for the image to form.
	Anyone looking into the ball sees out from the sensor, and can look around by looking into the ball at different angles.
	However, you cannot see anything more than a dozen metres from the sensor; the image becomes too distorted.
	You only get vision; no other senses.
	However, you still benefit from anything that enhances your vision, such as \featref{darkvision}.
	
	Scrying requires continuous concentration---you must remain within a metre of the \materialref{crystal-ball}, and can't manage any more significant actions than talking or idly knitting.
	You may only maintain one scrying sensor at a time.

	You can, and should, leave them in your head for this.
	This works only for you; other people cannot see in on your scrying.

	You can move it around as normal within this 2 metre radius of them, and it is dragged along behind them no matter how fast they move.

	However, you still need to be near the \materialref{crystal-ball} to form the image in the first place, or to move the sensor.
	Forming the image requires concentration, but moving it is as easy as glancing around.
	If you have \featref{scrying-speed}, refocusing entirely is still an {\action}.
	
	You can still only maintain one instance of scrying at a time.
	The image dissolves if you begin a new instance of scrying, and you can also dispel it at any time you choose.

\feat{Hindsight}{hindsight}{10}{

	Seeing the past is far easier than seeing the future, although you don't have any chance of changing it.
	
	You may enter hindsight at any time, without an {\action}.

	You sense things from where you are currently standing, so, for example, you could go back to see what happened in a room before you entered it.
	
	You sense everything in reverse, but at normal speed.
	For example, if you want to see what happened ten minutes before you began hindsight, you must wait ten minutes to rewind to that point.
	Speech is hard to interpret in reverse, requiring a \attref{wit} Test for anything but the most simplest phrases.
	You may end your hindsight at any time, and your senses immediately return to the present.
	You may maintain hindsight for as long as you can stay awake, but it ends if you fall asleep or unconscious.
	
	You may act normally while using hindsight, however your cannot sense your present surroundings, only the past.
	However, you may still feel things that you touch in the present, and conversely cannot touch anything in the past.
	This makes it quite disturbing when someone in the past walks straight through where you are currently standing.
	Additionally, hindsight breaks down and ends if you move too far from where you began it; you can manage a couple of metres without trouble, or more with a Test.
	
	While using hindsight, you benefit to any enhancements to your senses, such as \featref{darkvision}.
	However, you can only see \featref{scrying} images that existed in the time and place you are looking at.

	While in the {\mentalrealm}, you can extend your sense through \featref{scrying} surfaces; yours or other people's.
