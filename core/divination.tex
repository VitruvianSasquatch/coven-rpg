}{
	You can't quite see the future, as such, but you can tell when \emph{something} is about to happen.
	You might not know what it is, but it won't catch you entirely unawares.
	You may use your \skillref{divination} skill in place of any other skill when rolling {\initiative}, and may even use it when the {\initiative} Test would otherwise use no skill at all.

\feat{Perfect Prediction}{divination-dodge}{20}{
	\skillref[1]{divination},
	\featref{divination-initiative}
}{
	With your eyes closed and all your concentration turned to it, you can enhance your premonitions of danger with perfect clarity.
	Activating this effect requires an {\action}, and lasts until the beginning of your next {\turn}, or until you open your eyes.
	For the duration, you automatically evade any \actionref{attack} or other harmful effect that could reasonably be evaded, unless it hits you with a critical success.
	
	This only allows you to sense anything which may harm you, restrain you, or the like.
	With your eyes closed, you likely unaware of many other things.
	
	Furthermore, maintaining this for long periods is tiring.
	The GM may call for Tests to avoid {\exhaustion} after a minute or more of use.
