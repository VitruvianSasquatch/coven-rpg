\chaplabel{familiars}

A wizened old woman leans back in her rocking chair, eyes closed.
A white cat lies curled in her lap, its won eyes shut, purring as she rubs its chin.

A handsome, tanned woman stands on the peak of grassy hill, arm held aloft.
A falcon dives from above, alighting on her thick leather glove.
It casts its eyes north-west, then knowingly back at the witch.
With a sly grin, she casts the bird back into the air and strides downhill after it.

A bright-eyed girl, no more than thirteen, stands beside a bubbling cauldron, carefully teasing the seeds from a pine cone with a small knife.
``Sage leaf next, Harold?''
She looks up at the frog on the kitchen bench, as it croaks and nudgs one of the piles of herbs that surrounds it.
``Ohh, right. Rosemary. Of course\dots''
The girl shakes her head and tuts to herself as she counts out seven leaves into her hand and drops them in the cauldron.
Harold peers over from the bench, keeping a close eye on the brew as it slowly turns a deep blue.

\section{No Mere Beast}

A witch's familiar is no mere animal.
It is a fusion of summoned spirit, tamed beast, and a tiny sliver of soul from the witch herself.
Obtaining a familiar is one of the first steps for any witch-in-training, and the familiar often aids in the witch in her subsequent learning.

Familiars are intelligent creatures, in some cases even more intelligent than the witches they are bound to.
They understand language, though the limits of animal form mean that most are incapable of speech.
Despite this, that bond that a witch shares with her familiar allow them to communicate.
With simple looks and gestures a familiar can communicate great meaning to its witch, communicating as effectively as if through speech.
This ability does not extend to other witches, and especially not to layfolk, who may require a Test to interpret a familiar's communication.
Pointing and beckoning typically fairly unambiguous, however.
