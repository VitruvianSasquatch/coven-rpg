\chapter{Introduction}

\titleemph{Coven} is a role-playing game designed upon a simple premise: the player characters are witches and the party is a coven.
Every character shares the common tools of witchcraft: a familiar, a broomstick and, most importantly, a pointed hat.
However, that is often where the similarities end.
There are many different disciplines to witchcraft, and many different approaches even within a discipline.
From meticulous ritualists to soaring broom-riders, from shy girls to terrifying matriachs, hunched over a cauldron or chatting with squirrels in the forest, a coven can be a diverse lot.
